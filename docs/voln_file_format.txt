Earthsiege 2 - VOLN file schema (as observed / tested)

File Name : 4 bytes
[56 4F 4C 4E] = "VOLN"

Exe - DBSIM - 1 byte 
[00] = (flag, does DBSIM load this vol? 00 || 01)

Exe - VSHELL - 1 byte 
[00] = (flag, does VSHELL load this vol? 00 || 01)

Unknown - 3 bytes 
[00 00 00] = (most likely vol file options)

Load precedence - 1 byte
[05] = SHELL0, ZONES, SIMVOL0 have [05], but! SHELL1, SIMPATCH have [0A]

Total Directories - 1 byte
[06] = example (6), treated as uint8.

Directory List size in bytes
[1E 00] = example (30), the number of bytes that make up the directory list in the vol file.

File List Header total files - 2 bytes
[AA 00] = example, 170 files, so 170. (UINT16)

File List Header size in bytes - 4 bytes. (UINT32)
[F4 0B 00 00] = example, 3060. 
	NOTE: File List header entries are 18 bytes total.
		Filename = 12 bytes (Char[])
		UNKNOWN = 1 byte (UINT8)
		Directory index = 1 byte (UINT8)
		File offset in vol = 4 bytes (UINT32)

<18byte segments of file listings>

+ what follows then is all the file byte data.
+ each file has a 9-byte prefix that I'm still trying to figure out what it means.
+ File data is defined as [STARTING OFFSET + 9] to [NEXT FILE OFFSET].
